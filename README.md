# NBA Games Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the winners of NBA games based on the statistics of each team's previous performances.

## Files

- `parse_data.ipynb`: Process raw data in html files into readable csv format
- `analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis on the processed data

## Folders
- DS3 Competition
  - This folder contains all the initial files used to get, process, and demo the most basic form of the prediction model for a university-level data competition.
 
## Tableau

## Inspiration
The idea for this project and the starter code (`get_data.ipynb`,`parse_data.ipynb`) was inspired by [DataQuest](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/nba_games)
